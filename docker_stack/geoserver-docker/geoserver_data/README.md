# geoserver_data

Place GeoServer configuration files in here, which are used in the running GeoServer container based on this image.
These are mostly XML files, e.g. `wms.xml` for global WMS configuration or predefined workspaces (`workspaces/<my-workspace>/workspace.xml` and `workspaces/<my-workspace>/namespace.xml`).
